# Wicci Shim

An HTTP reverse-proxy server which bridges between a client's browser
and a PostgreSQL-based Wicci Web Server.  A key component of the NGender
Web Framework.

Several Wicci Shims have been written, starting with one
written in C.  The most ambitious is currently being written
in Rust.  The Rust Shim eschews most of the cost of
unsuitable concurrency, database and web frameworks and
libraries and should eventually replace all others.

This Wicci Shim is written in Racket, a remarkably clean and
powerful descendent of Scheme, a modern Lisp.  While this
Shim has more overhead than the Rust Shim in development, it
has nearly all of the desired features with much less code
and complexity.
